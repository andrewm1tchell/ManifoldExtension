# ManifoldExtension
Manifold Extension for onchain art.
Supports Lazy minting.

Requires you to also use the IManifoldERC721Edition.sol included in this repository to deploy. It is a slight modification to the original interface created by manifold.

This contract can span multiple series, and handle lazy minted generative artwork based on a token hash.

I used a form of this for my collections: FLUME and SKY MEADOW.

Obviously, test it in goerli before yelling at me if you are going to use this.
